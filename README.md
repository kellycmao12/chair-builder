# Interactive Modular Furniture Builder

This is a chair building/customization site I built in December 2023 for my Computer Graphics final at NYU. The user is able to customize several attributes of the 3D chair on screen (drawn with WebGL).
It is inspired by a project my friend made where she created stamps for chair legs, seats, and backs which could be mixed and matched to create custom chairs.
